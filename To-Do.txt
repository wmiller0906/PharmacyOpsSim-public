1. Address
-Better handling of exceptions. I don't want to kill the program, just let user know it failed.
 When I have GUI I want it to loop and have user try again unless they cancel.
- Validation inside constructors to make sure adding address  is correct (state numChar = 2, zipCode numDigits = 5).
2. User
- Implement username and password
- Test and debug
- Password changes every 6 months automatically
