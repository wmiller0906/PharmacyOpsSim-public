# PharmacyOpsSim-public

**PharmacyOpsSim** is a pharmacy operations management system written in C++, designed to evolve from a standalone simulation into a fully functional prototype for intelligent, adaptable pharmacy software. While it currently models core pharmacy workflows for demonstration purposes, the long-term goal is to develop a system with real-world application potential.

Key features include:

- Inventory management and predictive restocking logic
- Electronic prescription (eRx) handling
- Patient and prescription data entry
- Insurance billing simulation
- Product and order verification
- Workflow queues for distinct pharmacy roles (data entry, verification, billing)

This project is developed by a pharmacy technician and computer engineering student to demonstrate how industry experience can inform software design.

> **Note:** Current version is a standalone simulation and does **not** connect to live insurance providers, prescriber systems, or pharmacy management platforms. Future versions aim to expand in scope and capability.

## Goals

This project aims to address real-world challenges in pharmacy operations by combining personal industry experience with modern software and machine learning techniques. The core goals are:

1. **Client-Centered Design**  
   Leverage firsthand experience in pharmacy operations to build a system that directly reflects the practical needs and workflows of professionals in the field.

2. **Intelligent Inventory Management**  
   Apply machine learning to anticipate fluctuations in drug demand, enabling proactive inventory control that minimizes shortages and improves availability.

3. **Compliance Support for Patient Health**  
   Utilize predictive analytics to identify patients at risk of non-adherence, enabling pharmacies to intervene earlier and improve therapeutic outcomes.

4. **Regulatory Adaptability**  
   Design the system to be flexible and responsive to evolving healthcare regulations, ensuring ongoing compliance with both state and federal standards.
