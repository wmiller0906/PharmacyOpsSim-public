# PharmacyOpsSim-public

**PharmacyOpsSim** is a simulation of a pharmacy operations management system written in C++. It is designed to mirror real-world pharmacy workflow, including:

- Inventory management and product restocking
- Electronic prescription (eRx) handling
- Patient and prescription data entry
- Insurance billing simulation
- Product and order verification
- Workflow queues for different pharmacy roles (data entry, verification, billing)

This project is developed by a pharmacy technician and computer engineering student to demonstrate how industry experience can inform software design.

> **Note:** This is a standalone simulation. It does **not** interface with real insurance providers, prescriber systems, or pharmacy management systems.
